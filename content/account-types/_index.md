# Account Types

## Individual Taxable Account

Alpaca Securities LLC currently supports individual taxable accounts. With an individual taxable account, you'll be able
to fully utilize Alpaca for your automated trading and investing needs. You'll have access to our robust, user-friendly
API, which you'll be able to use to execute trades and receive real-time consolidated market data (please see
[Market Data]({{< relref "/market-data/_index.md" >}}) for more information). You'll also automatically be setup with a
paper trading account, which you can use to test your strategies before you deploy them with real money. And with the
Alpaca web dashboard, it's easy to monitor both your paper trading and your real money brokerage accounts.

### Who's eligible for a real money brokerage account?

At this time, Alpaca Securities LLC only provides individual taxable brokerage accounts to U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent 
residents, and H-1B and F1 visa holders.

There is **no minimum deposit** required to open an individual taxable account.


## Paper Trading Only Account

Alpaca also offers a free, paper trading only account. A paper trading only account allows you to fully utilize the 
Alpaca API and run your algorithm in our paper trading environment. You'll be able to track your activity and balance
in the Alpaca web dashboard just like real-money users can. Other than not being eligible to trade real money, the main
difference is the paper trading only account is only entitled to receive and make use of IEX market data (please see
[Market Data]({{< relref "/market-data/_index.md" >}}) for more information). For more information about our paper
trading environment, please refer to [Paper Trading Specification]({{< relref "/paper-trading/_index.md" >}}).

### Who's eligible for a paper trading only account?

Anyone! All you need to do is sign up for an Alpaca account by providing your email address.
