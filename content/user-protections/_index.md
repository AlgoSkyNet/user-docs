# User Protections
We have enabled several types of protections to enhance your trading experience.

* [Pattern Day Trader Protection (PDT)] ({{<relref "#pattern-day-trader-protection-pdt-at-alpaca">}})
* [Day Trade Margin Call (DTMC)] ({{<relref "#day-trade-margin-call-dtmc-at-alpaca">}})

## Pattern Day Trader Protection (PDT) at Alpaca
In order to prevent Alpaca Brokerage Account customers from unintentionally being
designated as a Pattern Day Trader (PDT), the Alpaca Trading platform checks the PDT
rule condition every time an order is submitted from a customer. If the order could potentially
result in the account being flagged as a PDT, the order is rejected, and API
returns error with HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).

### The Rule
A day trade is defined as a round-trip pair of trades within the same day. A
buy must be occur first and then a sell of the same security must come later
in the day. The inverse does not make a day trade. Selling short and
covering the short on the same day is also considered a day trade.

An account is designated as a Pattern Day Trader if it makes four (4) day
trades within five (5) business days. Day trades less than this criteria
will not flag the account for PDT.

### Alpacaâ€™s Order Rejection
Alpaca Trading platform monitors the number of day trades for the account
for the past 5 business days and rejects a newly submitted order if it
could potentially result in the account being flagged for PDT. This
protection triggers only when the previous day's closing account equity is less than $25,000 at
the time of order submission.

In addition to the filled orders, the system also takes into
consideration pending orders in the account. In this case, regardless of
the order of pending orders, a pair of buy and sell orders is counted as
a potential day trade. This is because orders that are active (pending)
in the marketplace may fill in random orders. Therefore, even if your
sell limit order is submitted first (without being filled yet) and
another buy order on the same security is submitted later, this buy
order will be blocked if your account already has 3 day trades in
the last 5 business days.

### Paper Trading
The same protection triggers in your paper trading account. It is
advised to test your algorithm with the realistic balance amount you
would manage when going live, to make sure your assumption works under
this PDT protection as well.

## Day Trade Margin Call (DTMC) at Alpaca
In order to prevent Alpaca Brokerage Account customers from unintentionally receiving day trading margin calls, Alpaca has enabled two forms of DTMC protections. We will be enabling these protections beginning Monday 8/5/2019.

By default, Alpaca users have DTMC protections **on entry** of a position. This means that if there is a risk of receiving a Day Trading Margin Call due to a specific trade, you will be blocked from making that trade. This option is the more conservative of the two DTMC protections that our users have.

The second DTMC protection option is protection **on exit** of a position. This means that Alpaca will block the exit of positions that may cause a Day Trading Margin Call. This may cause users of this protection method to be unable to sell a position.

One of the two protections will be enabled for all users (you cannot have neither protection enabled). If you would like to switch your protection option, please contact [our support](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### The Rule
Day traders are required to have a minimum of $25,000 OR 25% of the total market value of securities (whichever is higher) maintained in their account.

The buying power of a pattern day trader is 4x the excess of the maintenance margin from the closing of the previous day. If you exceed this amount, you will receive a day trading margin call.

### Paper Trading
The same protection triggers in your paper trading account. It is
advised to test your algorithm with the realistic balance amount you
would manage when going live, to make sure your assumption works under
this DTMC protection as well.
