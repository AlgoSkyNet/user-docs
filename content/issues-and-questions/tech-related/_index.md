# Tech-related Questions and Issues

## Slack

If you are looking for a community to voice your questions and discuss certain issues, [our community Slack](https://alpaca-community.slack.com) 
has become the go-to place for Alpaca users. The community consists of both experienced users and beginners. From basic 
questions about core features and API commands to discussions around how the market works as well and analysis of user
algorithms, [Slack](https://alpaca-community.slack.com) is the place where you can find most answers about our service 
as well as what is happening in the Alpaca system and what other users are experiencing in real time. Alpaca Slack members 
are incredibly supportive of each other and also try to answer questions as much as possible. For brokerage-related
questions or issues, we do **not** recommend looking for answers or support in Slack. Since most of brokerage-related 
issues can be solved only by Alpacaâ€™s brokerage operations team, you will want to contact the brokerage operations team 
directly by sending an email to **support@alpaca.markets**. Brokerage operations team members are not permitted to answer
questions or provide support on Slack due to regulatory reasons.


## GitHub

If you are wondering why some features that you think should be there are not there yet, you may find others who also 
thought about the same thing. If you are stuck with a bug and did not get any answers in the community Slack, you may 
see how others have found the same issue.

The [Alpaca API GitHub repository](https://github.com/alpacahq/Alpaca-API) is the place for you to file feature requests 
and issues you are experiencing. Users can see what issues others have encountered and contribute their own experiences
in the comments section of the reported issue. Users can also view and comment on requested features.

If you have technical issues specific to one of our [client SDKs]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}}),
please file the issue directly in the relevant SDK GitHub repo.

Lastly, please note that the GitHub repository is **not** a good place to report or find information regarding Alpaca's brokerage
service. Instead, you'll want to read our [Brokerage Service FAQ](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/), which 
specifically acts as our brokerage-related knowledge base.
