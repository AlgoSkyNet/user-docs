# Issues & Questions

There are generally two types of questions and issues that you may come up with when using Alpaca.

When you are running scripts calling the Alpaca API and find a potential bug, you probably have tech-related issue that
you want to report or ask about. If you are reading the API documentation and you have no clue how it works, you
probably have tech-related questions. However, if, for example, you are having a difficult time linking your bank
account to Alpaca, then you have a brokerage-related issue.

Due to regulations, tech-related and brokerage-related issues are handled differently at Alpaca. For this reason, we
have clearly distinguished our support lines for tech and brokerage. Because Alpaca is at the crossroads of financial
services and technology, some questions and issues may seem relevant to both technology and brokerage operations.
By detailing our support channels, we hope to help users understand where to go for different types of questions
and issues so that they may resolve them as quickly as possible.

## Brokerage-related Questions and Issues

### Support

If you are wondering why your brokerage application is stuck in processing, or if you are having trouble depositing
money to your brokerage account, then please send an email to our brokerage operations team at **support@alpaca.markets**. By law, we must
have licensed representatives handle such brokerage-related issues and requests.

Questions and issues that often arise include trouble linking a bank account, updating an address on file, and
correcting erroneous information provided during onboarding. But please do not email our operations team
if, for example, you are having trouble getting your API key to work (instead, check out our
[tech-related support channels]({{< relref "#tech-related-questions-and-issues" >}})).

### Alpaca Resources

If you have questions about certain terminology or how Alpaca's business works, please see
[Alpaca Resources](https://alpaca.markets/learn/). For example, you can find information about
pattern day trading, wash sale, tax-reporting as well as code examples and use cases with Alpaca API.



## Tech-related Questions and Issues

### Forum & Community Slack

If you are looking for a community to voice your questions and discuss certain issues, please visit [our forum](https://forum.alpaca.markets) or [our community Slack](https://alpaca-community.slack.com). For general feature and/or enhancement requests, check out the [Feature Requests category](https://forum.alpaca.markets/c/alpaca/feature-requests) in the Alpaca Forum.

The community consists of both experienced users and beginners. We have set up a variety of topics for users to discuss. Join in on the conversation and find relevant topics around trading, market data, Alpaca product, programming, trading personal projects, and more!

Since most of brokerage-related issues can be solved only by Alpacaâ€™s brokerage operations team, you will want to contact the brokerage operations team directly by sending an email to **support@alpaca.markets**. Brokerage operations team members are not permitted to answer
questions or provide support on our forum due to regulatory reasons.


### GitHub

In addition to the [Feature Requests category](https://forum.alpaca.markets/c/alpaca/feature-requests) in the Alpaca Forum, if you are wondering why some API features that you think should be there are not there yet, you may find others who also
thought about the same thing. If you are stuck with a bug and did not get any answers in the community Slack, you may
see how others have found the same issue.

The [Alpaca API GitHub repository](https://github.com/alpacahq/Alpaca-API) is the place for you to file API feature requests
and issues you are experiencing. Users can see what issues others have encountered and contribute their own experiences
in the comments section of the reported issue. Users can also view and comment on requested features.

If you have technical issues specific to one of our [client SDKs]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}}),
please file the issue directly in the relevant SDK GitHub repo.

Lastly, please note that the GitHub repository is **not** a good place to report or find information regarding Alpaca's business or FAQ. Instead, you'll want to visit [Alpaca Resources](https://alpaca.markets/learn/), which includes general FAQ, code examples, use cases, and more.
