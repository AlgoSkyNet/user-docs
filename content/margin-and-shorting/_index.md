# Margin & Short Selling

We are currently working on supporting margin trading and short selling. These features and more will initially
be available only as part of a new account plan designed specifically for high-volume algorithmic traders.
This new account plan is not for everyone and may require certain conditions of your trading activity.
Currently this program is only open to eligible U.S. residents who deposit and maintain $25,000 equity 
(due to FINRA's Pattern Day Trader rule). If you think this may be for you, 
please **[complete this form](https://goo.gl/forms/D9k1MMNtY9awXcum1)** and we'll contact you.
