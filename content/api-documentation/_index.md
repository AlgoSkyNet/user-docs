# API Documentation

In order to start using Alpaca Web API, you will need to obtain your API key. An API key consists of two strings, 
one called Key ID which always appears in your dashboard, and Secret Key, which appears only once when generating 
it. Make sure you keep both in your hands.

### [Web API v1]({{< relref "/api-documentation/web-api/_index.md" >}})

Web API v1 is used by legacy Alpaca accounts at Apex Clearing. It describes
how our API works in detail so you can prepare for your algorithm to interact with it.

### [Web API v2]({{< relref "/api-documentation/api-v2/_index.md" >}})
 
API v2 is used by Alpaca accounts at ETC. The API has been updated to support our newest features, including margin, shorting, and extended hours.

### [Client SDK]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}})

Alpaca also provides software development kits ("SDKs") [here]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}}) 
for Python, C#, Go, and Node to help interact with both v1 and v2 of the Alpaca Web API.

### [How-To Code Examples]({{< relref "/api-documentation/how-to/_index.md" >}})

Basic usage examples showing [how to do specific tasks]({{< relref "/api-documentation/how-to/_index.md" >}})
