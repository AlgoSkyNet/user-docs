# API Documentation

In order to start using Alpaca [Web API]({{< relref "/api-documentation/web-api/_index.md" >}}), you will
need to obtain your API key. An API key consists of two strings, one called
Key ID which always appears in your dashboard, and Secret Key, which appears
only once when generating it. Make sure you keep both in your hands.

### Web API

Read through our [Web API document]({{< relref "/api-documentation/web-api/_index.md" >}}). It describes
how our API works in details so you can prepare for your algorithm to interact with it.

You can also learn about [SDK for your language]({{< relref "/api-documentation/how-to/_index.md" >}}).
Choose one of the supported ones and start building your idea.

### Client SDK

Alpaca also provides software development kits ("SDKs") [here]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}}) 
for Python, C#, Go, and Node to help interact with the Alpaca Web API.
