## See if the Market is Open

With GET requests to our [`/v1/calendar`](https://docs.alpaca.markets/web-api/calendar/) and [`/v1/clock`](https://docs.alpaca.markets/web-api/clock/) endpoints, you can check if the market is open now, or view what times the market will be open or closed on a particular date.
