# Brokerage-related Questions and Issues

## Email 

If you are wondering why your brokerage application is stuck in processing, or if you are having trouble depositing
money to your brokerage account, then please send an email to our brokerage operations team at **support@alpaca.markets**. By law, we must
have licensed representatives handle such brokerage-related issues and requests.

Questions and issues that often arise include trouble linking a bank account, updating an address on file, and 
correcting erroneous information provided during onboarding. But please do not email our operations team 
if, for example, you are having trouble getting your API key to work.

## Zendesk FAQ

If you have questions about certain brokerage-related terminology or how Alpaca's brokerage business works, please read
our [Zendesk FAQ](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/). It is managed by Alpaca's brokerage operations team and
only contains information about our brokerage operations. For example, you can find content such as information about 
pattern day trading, but not about how you can port your Quantopian algos to Alpaca.
