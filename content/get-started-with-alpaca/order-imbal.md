*This example only works if you have a funded brokerage account or another means of accessing Polygon data.*

This algorithm is an active, daytrading strategy that captures small moves frequently using
order book imbalance as an indicator. The idea is not secret or new - it's a strategy that has
been studied in academia and the industry.

This example also gives you a good idea of how to use streaming data in an algorithm's code.
