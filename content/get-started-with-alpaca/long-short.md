*This example works with both paper and live trading.*

Alpaca provides support for several open-source SDKs which make interfacing with our API easy. Below are links to similar algorithms implemented in multiple languages using each supported SDK. Examples are available in [Python](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-python/blob/master/examples/long-short.py), [Javascript/Node.js](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-js/blob/master/examples/long-short.js), [Golang](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-go/blob/master/examples/long-short/long-short.go), and [C#/.Net](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-csharp/blob/develop/UsageExamples/MeanReversionPaperOnly.cs).
