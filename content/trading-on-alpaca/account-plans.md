## Alpaca Paper Only Account

Anyone globally can create an Alpaca Paper Only Account! All you need to do is [sign up](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup)
with your email address.

An Alpaca Paper Only Account is for **paper trading only**. It allows you to fully utilize the Alpaca API and
run your algorithm in our paper trading environment only. You won't be trading real money, but you will be able
to track your simulated activity and balance in the Alpaca web dashboard. As an Alpaca Paper Only Account
holder, you are only entitled to receive and make use of IEX market data. For more information about our paper
trading environment, please refer to [Paper Trading Specification]({{< relref "/trading-on-alpaca/paper-trading.md" >}}).

## Alpaca Brokerage Account

After creating an Alpaca Paper Only Account, you can enable live trading by becoming an Alpaca Brokerage Account
holder. This requires you to go through an account on-boarding process with Alpaca Securities LLC, a FINRA
member and SEC registered broker-dealer. Currently, we only support brokerage accounts for
qualified U.S. residents.

With a brokerage account, you will be able to fully utilize Alpaca for your automated trading and investing needs.
Using the Alpaca API, you'll be able to buy and sell stocks in your brokerage account, and you'll receive
real-time consolidated market data. In addition, you will continue to be able to test your strategies and
simulate your trades in our paper trading environment. And with the Alpaca web dashboard, it's easy to monitor
both your paper trading and your real money brokerage account. All accounts are opened as margin accounts. Accounts with $2,000
or more equity will have access to margin trading and short selling.

**Individual Taxable Account**

Alpaca Securities LLC supports individual taxable brokerage accounts. At this time, we do not support retirement accounts.
For a more formal overview, please see the [sign up page of the Alpaca Securities FAQ](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/sections/360001817852-Account-Sign-Up).
