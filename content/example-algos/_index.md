# Example Algorithms

These are sample algorithms built by Alpaca and the developer community. They're free to use and customize for your own purposes.

## S&P 500 Buy-on-Dip

This example demonstrates a basic trading algorithm that buys oversold stocks within the S&P 500 universe
using an exponential moving average indicator. The page explains details about how to structure the code as well.

## Benjamin Graham's Value Investment using pylivetrader

This algorithm implements Benjamin Graham's teaching using [pylivetrader](https://github.com/alpacahq/pylivetrader),
a python library that helps write trading algorithms in Quantopian style. This example also tells you
how to move your Quantopian algorithm to the Alpaca API.

## Order Book Imbalance Scalping Algorithm using streaming

With this algorithm, you can take advantage of a daytrading algorithm that makes many quick trades on a single
security to take advantage of penny-level order book imbalances. The idea is not secret
or new - it's a strategy that has been studied in academia and the industry.

This example also gives you a good idea of how to use streaming data in an algorithm's code.

## Google Spreadsheet Trading

Alpaca's trading API is not just about automation and frequency. Using a simple REST interface, you can build
your own user interface suitable for your own trading needs. Google Spreadsheet is a great software
that everyone can use, and with this example, you can trade directly from your portfolio
management spreadsheet.
