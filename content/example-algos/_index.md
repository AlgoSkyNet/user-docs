# Run Example Algorithms

The following is a list of working example algorithms built by Alpaca and the developer community. They can be 
immediately deployed in paper or live trading, and best of all, they're free to use and customize for your own 
purposes.

We want to emphasize that these examples are meant to be instructive and demonstrate some of the possibilities of 
the Alpaca platform. They have not been analyzed or tested for profitability. Use in live trading at your own 
discretion.
