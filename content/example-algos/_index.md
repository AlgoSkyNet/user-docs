## Benjamin Graham's Value Investment using pylivetrader

This algorithm implements Benjamin Graham's teaching using [pylivetrader](https://github.com/alpacahq/pylivetrader),
a python library that helps write trading algorithms in Quantopian style. This example also tells you
how to move your Quantopian algorithm into one for Alpaca API.

## HFT-ish Order Book Imbalance Algorithm using streaming

Ever wanted to get into HFT world? While the professional HFT world is all about speed and latency,
you can take advantage of commission-free and get into HFT-ish algorithm. The idea is not secret
or new, but implements a strategy that has been studied in academic and the industry.

This example also gives you a good idea of how to write a streaming-based algorithm code.

## Google Spreadsheet Trading

Trading API is not just automation and frequency. Using simpel REST interface, you can build
your own user interface suitable for your own trading needs. Spreadsheet is a great software
that everyone can use, and with this example, you can trade directly from your portfolio
