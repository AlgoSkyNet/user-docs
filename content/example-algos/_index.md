# Run Example Algorithms

The following is a list of working example algorithms built by Alpaca and the developer community. They can be 
immediately deployed in paper or live trading, and best of all, they're free to use and customize for your own 
purposes.

We want to emphasize that these examples are meant to be instructive and demonstrate some of the possibilities of 
the Alpaca platform. They have not been analyzed or tested for profitability. Use in live trading at your own 
discretion.

**The following algos can be tested if you have an Alpaca Paper Only Account or an Alpaca Brokerage Account:**

**[S&P 500 Buy-on-Dip]({{< relref "/example-algos/sp500-buy-dip/_index.md" >}})**

**[Google Spreadsheet Trading]({{< relref "/example-algos/google-spreadsheet/_index.md" >}})**

**The algos below can be tested only if you have an Alpaca Brokerage Account (if you try to run these without 
an Alpaca Brokerage Account, you'll get an error that the algo cannot pull the appropriate market data source):**

**[Benjamin Graham's Value Investment using pylivetrader]({{< relref "/example-algos/graham-value/_index.md" >}})**

**[HFT-ish Order Book Imbalance Algorithm Using Streaming]({{< relref "/example-algos/order-imbal/_index.md" >}})**

**[Build a Day-Trading Algorithm and Run it in the Cloud Using Only Free Services]({{< relref "/example-algos/daytrading-momentum/_index.md" >}})**

Got an interesting idea? Tell us about it in our [Slack](https://alpaca.markets/slack), and we can list it here.
