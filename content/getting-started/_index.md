# Where should I start?

If you are new to Alpaca, this is a great place to be! Here's a guide to quickly get up and running with Alpaca. If 
you still desire further information, please review all of the content on our Documentation and FAQ pages.

## Real-Money Trading Account

Once you complete the account application, your information will be reviewed for approval. For more information about 
account review process, please read our [FAQ page](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/sections/360001817852-Account-Sign-Up).

## Dashboard

Your account information will be available in your [dashboard](https://app.alpaca.markets/) page.
Here you can view your positions, historical performance, and orders, as well as
perform some operations such as depositing money, enabling and resetting [paper trading]({{< relref "/paper-trading/_index.md" >}}),
and updating your personal information.

## Deposit Your Money

In order to start trading, you need to deposit your money in your account.
Go to your dashboard, link your bank account, and initiate an ACH transfer from your bank to
your Alpaca account. Please also read our [FAQ page for banking](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/sections/360001964091-Banking-and-Transfers).

## Generate API Key

In order to start using the Alpaca [Web API]({{< relref "/api-documentation/web-api/_index.md" >}}), you will
need to obtain your API key. An API key consists of two strings. One is your **Key ID** which always appears in your 
dashboard, and the other is your **Secret Key**, which appears only once when generating it. Please keep them both
in a safe place.

## Learn how the API works

Please read through our [Web API document]({{< relref "/api-documentation/web-api/_index.md" >}}). It describes in detail
how our API works and how your algorithm can interact with Alpaca.

You can also learn about the [SDK for your language]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}}).
Choose one of the supported ones and start building your idea.

## Tutorial through a Sample Algorithm

You can learn the thought process by a [sample algorithm in Python]({{< relref "/getting-started/tutorials/python/_index.md" >}}). This is
a complete working scaffold which you can immediately start running.
Learn how an algorithm is structured and code API requests that you can
customize for your own needs.
