# About Us

## Who We Are

Alpaca Securities is a FINRA and SEC registered broker-dealer that launched in early 2018 to serve the needs 
of the growing community of software developers and technology-minded individuals. We offer a robust, user-friendly
API which can be used to automate your trading and investing. Our parent company, 
AlpacaDB Inc., is the creator of [MarketStore](https://github.com/alpacahq/marketstore), an open-source, 
performance geared time series database. Collectively, our team has several decades of experience in 
financial services and technology. You can check the background of Alpaca on FINRAâ€™s 
[BrokerCheck](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/288202).

## Business Model

Alpaca does not charge trading commissions!

Instead, Alpaca will launch a premium subscription plan, where premium users will have access to various perks, 
such as a higher quality real-time data feed and additional computing resources. 
The pricing and exact features have not yet been determined. Please stay tuned for updates.

Additionally, Alpaca makes money in many of the same ways as traditional online brokerages. These include:

* Interest on cash deposits
* Payment for order flow ("PFOF") - Alpaca receives remuneration for routing your orders to
market makers and exchanges. PFOF helps us offset the expense that occurs when clearing and executing our
customers' trades. You can read more about PFOF in our Medium post 
[here](https://medium.com/automation-generation/commission-free-trading-is-it-helping-or-hurting-you-dc5fdc22ca6a).
For SEC Rule 606, please visit the SEC site. *It is important to note that our customers are not charged.
* Margin financing - Alpaca may charge interest for margin loans.
* Stock loan - Alpaca may charge stock loan fees for users who want to borrow stock to short sell.

## Clearing Broker
Apex Clearing Corporation (Apex) is Alpaca's clearing firm and custodian. The cash and securities in 
your Alpaca account are held by Apex.

## SIPC Membership

Alpaca is a member of SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation). SIPC protects against the loss of 
cash and securities held by a customer up to $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash. SIPC does
not protect you for any decline in the value of your securities.

## Scheduled Downtime

Alpaca will usually roll out updates without the necessity for any system downtime, but occasionally 
downtime is unavoidable for specific upgrades to the API. The scheduled downtime window starts every 
Friday at 1:00 AM EST, and concludes at 4:00 AM EST. Note that often times the system will still be 
operational during this window if no downtime is needed.
