## Alpaca Paper Only Account

Anyone globally can create an Alpaca Paper Only Account! All you need to do is [sign up](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup) 
with your email address. 

An Alpaca Paper Only Account is for **paper trading only**. It allows you to fully utilize the Alpaca API and 
run your algorithm in our paper trading environment only. You won't be trading real money, but you will be able 
to track your simulated activity and balance in the Alpaca web dashboard. As an Alpaca Paper Only Account 
holder, you are only entitled to receive and make use of IEX market data. For more information about our paper
trading environment, please refer to [Paper Trading Specification]({{< relref "/paper-trading/_index.md" >}}).

## Alpaca Brokerage Account

After creating an Alpaca Paper Only Account, you can enable live trading by becoming an Alpaca Brokerage Account
holder. This requires you to go through an account on-boarding process with Alpaca Securities LLC, a FINRA
member and SEC registered broker-dealer. Currently, we only support brokerage accounts for 
qualified U.S. residents.

With a brokerage account, you will be able to fully utilize Alpaca for your automated trading and investing needs.
Using the Alpaca API, you'll be able to buy and sell stocks in your brokerage account, and you'll receive 
real-time consolidated market data. In addition, you will continue to be able to test your strategies and 
simulate your trades in our paper trading environment. And with the Alpaca web dashboard, it's easy to monitor 
both your paper trading and your real money brokerage account.

**Individual Taxable Account**

At this time, Alpaca Securities LLC only provides individual taxable brokerage accounts.
For a more formal overview, please see the [sign up page of the Alpaca Securities FAQ](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/sections/360001817852-Account-Sign-Up).

**Account for LLC or other business entities?**
