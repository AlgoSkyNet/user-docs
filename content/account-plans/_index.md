# Account Plans

## Alpaca Paper Account

Anyone can create an Alpaca Paper Account! All they need to do is [sign up](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup) with
their email address. 

An Alpaca Paper Account allows you to fully utilize the Alpaca API and run your algorithm in our paper trading 
environment. You'll also be able to track your activity and balance in the Alpaca web dashboard. The main difference 
is the Alpaca Paper Account is only entitled to receive and make use of IEX market data unless the account holder has
also created an Alpaca Brokerage Account. For more information about our paper
trading environment, please refer to [Paper Trading Specification]({{< relref "/paper-trading/_index.md" >}}).

## Alpaca Brokerage Account

After creating an Alpaca Paper Account, U.S. residents are eligible to create an Alpaca Brokerage Account. With a brokerage 
account, you'll be able to fully utilize Alpaca for your automated trading and investing needs. You'll have access to our 
robust, user-friendly API, which you'll be able to use to execute trades and receive real-time consolidated market data. 
And with the Alpaca web dashboard, it's easy to monitor both your paper trading and your real money brokerage accounts.

**Indiviual Taxable Account**

At this time, Alpaca Securities LLC only provides individual taxable brokerage accounts.
