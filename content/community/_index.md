# Community

At Alpaca, we truly believe open source and the community around it can change financial systems and
how we interact with them. It is our commitment to contribute to the community as much as possible.
With that in mind, we set up a few initiatives where you can learn from and contribute to the community.

As you get deeper into trading and automation, there are many questions and hurdles that you may face
while trying things out. We find that our community has been growing rapidly to share what they do with
each other. Alpaca grows with our community and knowledge is built together.

## Alpaca Forum
[Alpaca's community forum](https://forum.alpaca.markets) is recommended venue for Alpaca users to discuss topics ranging from trading, algorithms, programming, market data, etc. The forum is also a place to find up-to-date announcements about Alpaca and its features. The forum is the recommended place for discussion, since it has more advanced indexing and search functionality compared to our other community channels.

There are various topics set up for users to discuss, including:

**Alpaca - Alpaca Questions** - Users can ask questions specifically about Alpaca.

**Alpaca - Feature Requests** - Users can add different feature requests here.

**Programming - Questions & Issues** - Users can post questions or issues regarding Alpaca technology and receive help.


## Community Slack

[Alpaca’s community Slack](https://alpaca.markets/slack) has grown to be the go-to place for Alpaca
users regardless of experience or the stage of where they are in the journey of trading. The community
consists of both very experienced users and beginners. From questions about basic features and
API instructions to discussions about how the market works and analysis of algorithms they are
building, the community Slack is the place where you can chat with other community members with
similar experience as well as those who are already running profitable strategies.

There are multiple community-built channels in the community Slack. Popular channels that you may want to
subscribe to include:

**#random** - Everyone who joins the community Slack automatically joins here. Jump right in to discussions
ranging from simple coding questions to specific features that Alpaca offers.

**#announcement** - Everyone automatically joins here. This is a ready-only channel for the community
members and is a place where you can find feature updates and read official announcements from Alpaca.

**#api** - Technical focused discussions regarding the Alpaca API including issues and findings encountered
by the community.

**#algo-development & #algotrading** - Highly technical channels where members share and
discuss their code, ask questions, and solicit feedback of their strategies.

**#python** - Python is a popular language for writing trading strategies thanks to Quantopian. Many
Quantopian users are active in our community Slack and discuss open source resources used to support
existing Quantopian algorithms.

**#zipline-strategies** - This is another Quantopian influenced channel where members talk about
compatibility and Quantopian’s open source zipline resources.
