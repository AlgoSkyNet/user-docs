## Building the Site Locally

You can make changes to the markdown files holding site content here on GitHub, but if you'd like to see your changes
locally before you submit, you can follow these steps.

1. Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). If on OSX, install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install hugo`.
1. In the project directory, run `hugo server`.
1. If you follow the link in hugo's output, you'll be taken to a local version of the site with the changes you've made.

On your local version of the site, you can check any pages that will be affected by the changes you've made.
